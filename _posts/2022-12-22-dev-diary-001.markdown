I'm trying to create a discord bot that will remind me when the anime I'm tracking is airing

went down a rabbit hole of virtual environments whilst trying to install pycurl
gave up and decided to use requests instead; there's supposedly a hit in performance but that doesn't really matter

looked at MyAnimeList API documentation
hard to make sense of OAuth2.0 and PKCE
