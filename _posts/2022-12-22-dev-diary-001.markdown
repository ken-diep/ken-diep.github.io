I'm trying to create a discord bot that will remind me when the anime I'm tracking is airing  

Went down a rabbit hole of virtual environments whilst trying to install pycurl  
Gave up and decided to use requests instead; there's supposedly a hit in performance but that doesn't really matter in this context  

Looked at MyAnimeList API documentation; it's hard to make sense of OAuth2.0 and PKCE
