Got a repo created for this project  

Expanding the program to get user inputs  
Another thought: the bot could integrate with an MAL account and automatically pull animes that the user is watching  

Used datetime module to grab the current date  
MAL API provides the air date and time of the show  

Thought I could get the bot to ping a message on discord if the initial air date + current episode x weeks = today  
Annoyingly, MAL doesn't update episode counts for airing shows. E.g. One Piece is at an episode count of 0  
So I need to use the airing status of the show and print a reminder if the current day of the week is the same as the air day (which is conveniently available on MAL)  

Need to convert times from Japan to local; pytz appears to be a module that can help with this.
