Continuing to look at OAuth2.0 documentation  

The start of the process on client side:  
1. Generate a code verifier, which is a string of alphanumeric characters  
2. Hash this and it becomes the code challenge. Then SHA-256 and base64 URL encode the resulting hash.

If the code challenge method is "plain", the code challenge is the same as the code verifier (an important detail that I only found out through an obscure blog post :'))

Found out that MAL doesn't require PKCE for accessing public data (i.e. not user info)  
Need to register API on MAL profile first to get a client ID for accessing API  
This client ID is embedded as a header field, not in params. Headers = metadata I guess

Got a 200 response from MAL, good news!
