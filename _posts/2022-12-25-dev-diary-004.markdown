Set up this blog!  

Followed a great tutorial to set it up https://tseknet.com/blog/startblogging  
One of rare tutorials I've followed where every step went smoothly

I've done a Ruby course on codecademy recently so Jekyll seemed ideal

I think the No Zero Days, promoted by Shawn swyx Wang, is a great concept. Publically documenting the progress I make can only be a good thing IMO.
